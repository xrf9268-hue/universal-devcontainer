# Optional: Dependency Review
#
# This workflow requires the "Dependency graph" feature to be enabled.
# Path: Repository Settings → Code security and analysis → Dependency graph
#
# Requirements:
#   - Public repository, OR
#   - Private repository with GitHub Advanced Security license
#   - Dependency graph feature enabled (requires admin access)
#
# To enable this workflow:
#   1. Ensure dependency graph is enabled in repository settings
#   2. Rename this file from .optional to .yml
#      mv dependency-review.optional.yml dependency-review.yml
#   3. Commit and push
#
# Why it's optional:
#   - Requires admin permissions to enable dependency graph
#   - Not available on forked repositories by default
#   - Main security-scan.yml already provides comprehensive scanning via Trivy
#   - This adds license compliance checking and additional dependency analysis
#
